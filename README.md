# Storefront Frontend

Storefront Frontend is an Angular application developed as one of the requirements for the completion of Udacity's Full Stack JavaScript Developer Nanodegree. The app allows users to view a list of available products to purchase, add them to a shopping cart, and ultimately complete the checkout process. 

## Configuration

The app was developed to use local data from `data.json` file. Subsequent update to this project will fetch data from a backend API to mimick a real world e-commerce application.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js
- AngularJS
- Text editor e.g. Visual Studio Code

#### Project features

This application reflects the same user experience as that of a real-world e-commerce website, including a(n):

* **Product list** page, which displays the available products for the user to choose and add to their cart (in various quantities).
* **Product details** page, which displays more information about any particular product.
* **Shopping cart**, which includes the products that the user has added to their cart.
* **Checkout form**, which collects information about the user (e.g., name, address, payment details, etc.).
* **Order confirmation page**, which shows the outcome after the user completes the checkout process (i.e., submits the checkout form).
